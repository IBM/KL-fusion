# Model Fusion with Kullback-Leibler Divergence
This repository contains code for our ICML 2020 paper "Model Fusion with Kullbackâ€“Leibler Divergence", S. Claici, M. Yurochkin, S. Ghosh and J. Solomon.

## Dependencies
The code is written in Python3 and depends on cvxpy, numpy, sklearn, scipy, POT, and matplotlib for plotting.

## Running
`run_simulation_with_plots.py` demonstrates how to use KL-fusion on simulated data and reproduces Figures 6 and 7.
